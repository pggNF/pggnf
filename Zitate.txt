Um Amerika wieder groß zu machen, verkünde ich hiermit meine Kandidatur zur Präsidentschaft der Vereinigten Staaten.
November 2022

“Because I have created such an incredible economy, I have created so many jobs. 
I have made this country with you so great that everybody wants to come in.”

“Because we are American and our hearts bleed red, white, and blue. You know that.”

“But I’ve done so many campaign – I’m so far ahead. But – but we’ve started the wall. 
And it’s moving. And we’re going to get it, but get me some Republican votes, please.”
