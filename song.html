        <!-- Song Lyrics -->
        <pre>
       Verse 1)
Out here in Montana, where the sky's so wide,
We’re working hard, standing strong with pride.
For the land of the free, we know who leads,
A man who fights for all our needs.

(Chorus)
Stand tall with Trump, Montana proud,
With him in charge, we'll sing out loud!
He’ll keep us strong, keep jobs at home,
With Donald Trump, we’ll never roam!

(Verse 2)
From the plains to the mountains, ranches and the mines,
Trump's the man who’ll hold the line.
Fighting for our rights, from east to west,
He’ll put Montana to the test.

(Chorus)
Stand tall with Trump, Montana proud,
With him in charge, we’ll sing out loud!
He’ll keep us strong, keep jobs at home,
With Donald Trump, we’ll never roam!

(Bridge)
For liberty and justice, we’re here to stay,
With Trump in office, we'll pave the way!
Montana’s future is shining bright,
Together with Trump, we’ll win the fight!

(Chorus - Repeat)
Stand tall with Trump, Montana proud,
With him in charge, we'll sing out loud!
He’ll keep us strong, keep jobs at home,
With Donald Trump, we’ll never roam!

(Outro)
Let’s vote for Trump, let’s make it right,
Montana strong, our future bright!
He’s the man for you and me,
Trump will keep our country free!
        </pre>
